# HITW_close_the_gap

## The context
This project has been realized in the context of the hackathon [Hack In The Woods 2022](https://www.hackinthewoods.be/) for the organization [Close The Gap](https://www.close-the-gap.org/)


## The Project: What does the repackaging data tell us?

#### The context

Close the Gap coordinates the collection, refurbishment and shipment of electronic equipment so
that it can be used again for social projects.

#### How does it work?
1. The NGO receives a request to send equipment, sometimes with a list of the equipment;
2. The NGO picks up the equipment and sends it to one of its three reconditioning partners;
3. It receives a list of the material that has been reconditioned, a different format for each partner;
4. The material is sent to a local donor.


#### The challenge
The lack of a common structure in the listings makes it impossible to use the data. The creation
of a tool that standardises the different sources could change everything by finally offering the
possibility of reporting.
